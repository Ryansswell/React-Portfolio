# React-Portfolio

Professional README.md for my Portfolio using REACT!

## Description

This is my latest version of my portfolio and I did it using React! In my portfolio I have some of my favorite projects along with much more. In my portfolio I have made it easily accessible to see my LinkedIn, About Me section and my Github profile. This was one of our projects during my coding boot camp and I plan on updating this frequently.

## Usage

Provided a quick look into my portfolio and easy way for all my career materials to be combined!

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

npm install

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

npm start

Your app should now be running on http://localhost:3000. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
